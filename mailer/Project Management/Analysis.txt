A mail composer is basically a editor where user can drag and drop templates items which can be editable.
He should be able to set the text or image and  give some properties to it. 

Templates items will be like header, footer, title, image, image with caption etc.

These template items when combined make one template

Initially a default template will be shown a header a blank body part and a footer will be placed.
Then user can drag the templates from the left hand side and drop it where ever he wants. 
The respective template item will be added at that place.

When user is done with the template creation he can click on the Generate Html and the template will be generated in simple html format. which he can use as his mail template or any where else he would like it to be useful.


Coding Strategy

Build the skeleton of the editor first.
Editor will be of two parts the template item holder and the template generation box.

Template Generation Box
There will be a basic designed format. at he center will be the droppable object where we can drop the template items. Lets call it the "Template Holder".

Upon the Template-Holder layer there will be a Template-Item editor toolbar which gets visible on the currently hovered template item. When we receive a click on the Editor we will display the Properties Panel where user can set the properties for that particular template item.

Template Item Holder
On the left hand side a side bar sized box will contains all the draggable template items.
We can drag them and drop them on the Template-Holder

Properties panel
And the same will be used for displaying the Properties-Panel with a save button, on click of that button changes will be applied to the template and properties panel will be closed.
